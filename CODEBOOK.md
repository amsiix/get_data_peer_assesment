# Averaged Data CodeBook

The data resides in averaged_data.txt. It is a summarization of the UCI HAR Dataset, which is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, from Samsung (more information available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The data contains body acceleration variables in each of the three axis, as well as gyroscope readings for multiple activities, as described in the activity column. These values are summarize by their average in each of the variables of the dataset. Thus, for example,  `mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-X` represents the average of the mean values of the body acceleration in the X axis. 
 
As per the orinal specification, the values are normalized and should be bounded in the [-1,1] interval.
